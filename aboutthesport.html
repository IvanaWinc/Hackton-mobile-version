          Rotterdam Roller Derby is run by the members of the league.
          We have a Rotterdam mentality; roll up your sleeves, buckle down
          and do not complain. That mentality has brought us to where we are now.
          A league with attention for everyone! What does that mean? Anyone
          who has a warm heart for roller derby is welcome to our league.
          We support athletes as well as recreational players. We facilitate
          the development of officials. Our vision is to be open to all experiences
          and needs of our members. Therefore, we believe, above all, in the importance
          of having fun together. Our official motto “Sterker door Strijd” and unofficial
          “Sterker door Snacks” signify this as well
